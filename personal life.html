<h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Quavious Keyate Marshall was born on April 2, 1991, in Athens, Georgia.[4] Marshall's mother, Edna Marshall, was a hairdresser and his father died when he was four years old.[5][6] The three members of the Migos grew up together in Gwinnett County, a mostly suburban area half an hour northeast of Atlanta.[7]

Marshall attended Berkmar High School and was the starting quarterback of its football team during the 2009 season, his senior year.[7] Berkmar went 1-9 in the 2009 season, and Marshall went 19-of-25 for 201 yards and three touchdowns for the first win of the season.[8][9] Quavo previously held the record by completing 28 passes in a game back in 2009.[10]

Despite finishing the football season for his senior year, Marshall dropped out of Berkmar months before graduation.[7]

Marshall received the MVP Award during the 2018 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game after a 19 point performance and victory.[11] In 2019, Marshall played on the "Away" roster during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina,[12] and again during the 2020 All-Star Celebrity Game in Chicago.</p>
